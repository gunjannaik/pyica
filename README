A pure python package for Independent Component Analysis (ICA).  Currently, only fixed-point FastICA is supported.

See the documentation in the modules for detailed usage and function arguments.  Assuming you've cloned into a location python knows about and you want to extract
n <= N sources from a data matrix X of size N x T, you can do

	import pyica.fastica as ica
	A,W,S = ica.fastica(X,n)

All source code is made available under the BSD-3 license.

There is currently minimal testing code in the tests/ directory.  There are two ways to run the tests.  If you have pytest, run:

	>py.test -v testing_pytest.py

If you don't have pytest, you can run the test via distutils:

	>python setup.py test
